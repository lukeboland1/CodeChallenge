# CodeChallenge
1. Server application - MyServer.java in the CodeChallenge directory.
2. Client application - MyClient.java in the root directory.

How I ran it:
1. Import the CodeChallenge project into your IDE and run MyServer.java
2. Compile MyClient.java and run MyClient in two seperate cmd consoles
3. Game will begin once both Clients connect.

# CodeChallenge
1. Server application - MyServer.java in the CodeChallenge directory.
2. Client application - MyClient.java in the root directory.

How I ran it:
1. Clone the CodeChallege repository into your IDE (I used Eclipse).
2. Run MyServer.java in your IDE.
3. Compile MyClient.java using the command line and run MyClient in two seperate cmd consoles.
4. Game will begin once both Clients connect.
